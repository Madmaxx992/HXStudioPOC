# HXStudioPOC

## Description
Leveraging Prompt Engineering, we propose to develop a Proof-of-Concept (POC) for the HX Studio Application. We will utilize leading AI tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot to generate code for both the backend and frontend components. This will include the creation of the folder structure for optimal organization.

## Requirement
The application will have two user roles: User and Admin. A dedicated admin panel will be developed to provide administrative functionalities.

### Admin Features:
**Dashboard:** 
Upon successful login, admins will land on a dashboard page.

**Image Management:**

- Upload images of any size.
- Edit image details (category, subcategory, domain, subdomain, description, tags) during image updates.
- Edit, delete, or update existing images and their associated attributes.
